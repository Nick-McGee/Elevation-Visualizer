# Elevation Visualizer
A web application to easily create topography art. The goal is to allow the user to select an area on the map, and the program will draw topography lines over the area. Future features include allowing the user to change the line and background colour, and and adjust the thickness and the spacing of the lines.

This project is currently created and maintained by Nicholas McGee.
